const express = require('express');
const app = express();
const port = 3001; // Use a different port// initializing the port with a variable

app.get('/', (req, res) => { //So we're going to use the App.get method, which comes from Express,and then the path or the endpoint
    res.send('Hi Guys'); //Now next comes an anonymous function and we can tap into the request and response.
    //So it's written usually like this req and res and inside the curly braces, we can define what we should
    //do once we receive this get request at this endpoint.
    //inside this anonymous function or more importantly, we want to be able to send back a response.
    //To do that, we use res.send.And in the body of this method we can send back a piece of text.
});
//here we created a listen method n specify firstly the port 
//secondly the callback for what should happen when our server is ready to go
//we put an anonomus function as callback
app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`Server running on port ${port}`);
});

//method listen // 3000 is the port , port is the location of our  server
//callback func that is going to be triggered when our server is set up



We're going to try this out in our exercise so that instead of just writing a server that runs, we're
going to add to this exercise so that our server can handle the forward slash forward slash contact
and forward slash about endpoints, it's totally up to you what you want your server to send back on
the home endpoint.
And on the about endpoint, you could maybe have some info about yourself, maybe a paragraph element

or an H1 or something like that.

It's totally up to you how you want to do it.
I'm going to do is copy this part of my code.
The get method and paste it twice so that I get two more endpoints that I can add.
So the first one is the about endpoint, and in my case, I'm just going to write an H1 called about me.

And then maybe I can also have a paragraph tag saying my name is Angela, close my paragraph tag.

That's all the HTML that I'm going to send over.
And then the third endpoint is the contact endpoint.
And in this case, I'm going to have an H1 that says contact me and I'm going to have a paragraph that
says maybe my phone number is plus four, four, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight,nine.
And then let's close off our paragraph tag and notice how Nodemon is working hard in the background,
noticing these changes and updating and restarting our server so we can simply go back over to our localhost
3000.
